-- Action definitions for KOAssistant
-- Actions are UI elements (buttons) that trigger AI interactions
--
-- This module separates concerns:
--   - Actions: UI definition, context, behavior control, API parameters
--   - Templates: User prompt text (in templates.lua)
--   - System prompts: AI behavior variants (in system_prompts.lua)
--
-- NEW ARCHITECTURE (v0.5):
--   System array: behavior (from variant/override/none) + domain [CACHED]

--
-- Action schema:
--   id               - Unique identifier (required)
--   text             - Button display text (required)
--   context          - Where it appears: "highlight", "book", "multi_book", "general", "both" (required)
--   template         - User prompt template ID from templates.lua (required for builtin)
--   prompt           - Direct user prompt text (for custom actions without template)
--   behavior_variant - Override global behavior: "minimal", "full", "none" (optional)
--   behavior_override- Custom behavior text, replaces variant entirely (optional)
--   extended_thinking- Override global thinking: "off" to disable, "on" to enable (optional)
--   thinking_budget  - Token budget when extended_thinking="on" (1024-32000, default 4096)
--   api_params       - Optional API parameters: { temperature, max_tokens }
--   skip_language_instruction - Don't include user's language preferences in system prompt (optional)
--   include_book_context - Include book metadata with highlight context (optional)
--   description      - Human-readable summary of what the action does (optional, shown in details view)
--   enabled          - Default enabled state (default: true)
--   builtin          - Whether this is a built-in action (default: true for this file)
--   storage_key      - Override chat save location (optional):
--                      nil/unset: Default (current document, or __GENERAL_CHATS__ for general context)
--                      "__SKIP__": Don't save this chat at all

Guidance for fiction:
- **Characters**: The heart of the X-Ray. Include named characters, groups, and entities the reader encounters, not just protagonists. For major characters (protagonist, antagonist, key supporting), write 2-3 sentences covering personality, their arc through the story, pivotal moments or turning points, and their current situation. For minor characters, 1-2 sentences suffice. Always include aliases and connections with relationship type.
- **Locations**: For significant locations, convey atmosphere and what unfolds there. Minor locations need only a brief note. Include references to characters or items associated with each location.
- **Themes**: Include themes, motifs, and recurring ideas, not just the central ones. For major themes, trace how they develop through specific characters, conflicts, and events. For minor motifs or recurring ideas, a brief note suffices. Include references to characters or items that embody each theme.
- **Lexicon**: In-world terms, cultural references, or specialized vocabulary. Keep definitions concise — this is reference material.
- **Timeline**: Chronological — include significant events, not just major plot points. Cover character moments, revelations, turning points, and developments across each chapter. Each event should have a chapter reference and involved characters.
- __FICTION_STATUS_GUIDANCE__
- **Output size**: This is a reference companion, not a retelling. Prioritize depth over breadth. Give detailed entries for significant items and brief entries for minor ones. Include all items the reader encounters, but keep minor entries concise to stay within output limits.

  __NONFICTION_STATUS__
}

Guidance for non-fiction:
- **Key Figures**: Include people, groups, institutions, and historical actors discussed or referenced, not just central figures. For central figures (the author's main interlocutors, key researchers, historical actors), write 2-3 sentences covering who they are, what ideas or work they contribute, how the author engages with them (agrees, critiques, builds on), and their significance to the argument. For briefly mentioned figures, 1-2 sentences. Always include aliases (alternate names, shortened forms, titles the text uses to refer to them) and connections where figures relate to each other.
- **Locations**: Cities, regions, institutions, and historically significant places discussed in the text. For each, note what it is, its significance to the subject matter, and what events or arguments are connected to it. Include references to key figures or concepts associated with each place.
- **Core Concepts**: Include concepts, theories, frameworks, and ideas the author introduces, develops, or critiques. For central concepts, explain what they mean and how the author develops them through evidence, examples, or reasoning. For peripheral concepts, a brief definition suffices. Include references to key figures or other items that develop each concept.
- **Arguments**: Include claims, propositions, and arguments the author advances or engages with, not just the central thesis. For major arguments, capture the claim, evidence or reasoning, and counter-arguments addressed. For minor or supporting arguments, a brief statement suffices. Include references to key figures or concepts involved.
- **Terminology**: Specialized vocabulary, jargon, or terms the author defines. Keep concise — this is reference material.
- **Argument Development**: Track the intellectual progression across the work. Include developments, turning points, and shifts in each chapter or section — not just the main thesis but subsidiary arguments and case studies. Each entry should show how it advances or complicates the discussion. Include references to key figures or concepts involved.
- __NONFICTION_STATUS_GUIDANCE__
- **Output size**: This is a reference companion, not a retelling. Prioritize depth over breadth. Give detailed entries for significant items and brief entries for minor ones. Include all items discussed in the text, but keep minor entries concise to stay within output limits.

- OMIT categories entirely if nothing changed in them — they will be preserved as-is

- When modifying an existing entry, output the COMPLETE entry with all fields (it will replace the old version)
- To reference an existing entity, use the EXACT name from the entity list above
- You MUST always include "current_state" (fiction) or "current_position" (nonfiction) — these are always considered changed

If the previous analysis is in plain text rather than JSON, produce a fresh COMPLETE JSON analysis using the appropriate schema for the content type (fiction or nonfiction).

Guidelines:
- Add new characters, locations, themes, concepts, or key figures that appeared in the new content
- Add aliases and connections for new characters/key figures
- Update existing entries only when the new content reveals significant new information (arc developments, turning points, shifting relationships)
- Add new timeline/argument_development entries for events in the new content

{highlights_section}

## Characters
For each significant character the reader has encountered by this point:
- **Name** — Role and who they are
- Key relationships and connections to other characters
- Their arc and motivations so far (3-5 sentences for major, 1-2 for minor)

## Themes
Major themes emerging up to this point:
- **Theme** — How it manifests through characters, events, or arguments
- How it's developing (not how it resolves)

## Setting
Significant places and world-building:
- **Place** — What it is, its atmosphere, significance, key events there

## Key Terms
Important terminology, in-world vocabulary, or specialized concepts:
- **Term** — Definition and relevance

## Where Things Stand
A paragraph capturing the current state of the narrative or argument — active tensions, open questions, the momentum carrying the reader forward.

Adapt section names for the work type (e.g., "Key Figures" and "Arguments" for non-fiction). Use **bold** for names and terms. If highlights are provided, note what caught the reader's attention and how it connects to the broader work.

CRITICAL: Do not reveal ANYTHING beyond {reading_progress}. No foreshadowing, no future developments, no hints about what comes next.

{text_fallback_nudge}

Write a quick recap to help me re-immerse. Adapt your approach based on content type:

**For FICTION** - Use a "Previously on..." narrative style:
1. **Sets the scene** - The story's situation at this point
2. **Recent events** - What happened recently (prioritize recent over early)
3. **Active threads** - Conflicts, mysteries, or goals in play
4. **Where I stopped** - The specific moment or scene where I paused

**For NON-FICTION** - Use a "Where we left off..." refresher style:
1. **Main thesis** - The author's central argument (briefly)
2. **Recent ground covered** - Key points from recent chapters
3. **Current focus** - What the author is currently examining
4. **Building toward** - What questions or arguments are being developed

Style guidance:
- Match the work's tone (suspenseful for thrillers, rigorous for academic, accessible for popular non-fiction)
- Use **bold** for key names, terms, and concepts
- Use *italics* for important revelations or claims
- Keep it concise - this is a refresher, not a full summary
- If the reader has highlighted passages, note what they found notable
- No spoilers beyond {reading_progress}

Looking at my highlights as a collection, what themes or ideas am I tracking?
Are there connections between highlights I might not have noticed?

## My Notes Tell a Story
What do my notes reveal about my thinking? How is my understanding or reaction evolving?

## Questions I Seem to Be Asking
Based on what I highlight, what larger questions might I be exploring?
What am I curious about or paying attention to?

## Suggestions
Based on my highlighting patterns:
- Parts I might want to revisit
- Themes to watch for going forward
- Connections to other ideas or works
